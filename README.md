# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Assignment
DRY, which stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself." It's all about avoiding duplication in your code. By reusing code and keeping things concise, you can make your code more maintainable and reduce the chances of introducing bugs. It's like decluttering your code and making it more efficient!

YAGNI, which stands for "You Ain't Gonna Need It." This principle reminds us not to overcomplicate our code by adding unnecessary features or functionality. Instead, focus on what is currently needed and avoid adding extra complexity. It helps keep your code lean and prevents you from wasting time on things that might not be useful in the end.

SOLID is an acronym that represents five principles of object-oriented design. Each letter stands for a different principle, but I'll give you a brief overview. These principles help make your code more modular, flexible, and easier to maintain.

S - Single Responsibility Principle: Each class or module should have a single responsibility.
O - Open/Closed Principle: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
L - Liskov Substitution Principle: Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types.
I - Interface Segregation Principle: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use.
D - Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.

These principles help promote good design practices and make your code more robust.
